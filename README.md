# FinalProject

The final project of my Mobile Applications class in which I learned to program and devlop applications using Android Studio and JAVA. In this app, the user is presented with an interactive crime scene. The user is able to interact with various pieces of evidence left at the crime scene. The user can also navigate to a suspect list where descriptions and key facts are listed. With this and other information, the user must accurately frame a criminal. This app uses numerous technologies including data visualization, a navigation system, and fragments.
